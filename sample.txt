# LangGraph

LangGraph is a modern tool used for visualizing, building, and managing large-scale computational graphs. 
It allows users to see dependencies between nodes, analyze data flows, and interact with graphs dynamically. 
LangGraph is widely used in AI, data science, and engineering workflows for debugging and designing models.

Key Features:
- Node Visualization: Displays individual nodes and connections clearly.
- Interactive Graphs: Allows zooming, panning, and node manipulation.
- Data Analysis: Supports inspecting intermediate data in computational pipelines.
- Extensibility: Can integrate with Python scripts, AI frameworks, and APIs.
- Graph Persistence: Stores graph structure for later retrieval and analysis.
- Collaboration: Multiple users can work on the same graph simultaneously.

Applications:
1. Machine Learning: Understanding neural network architectures and data flow.
2. Scientific Computing: Representing simulations and experiments.
3. Software Engineering: Visualizing program dependencies and workflows.
4. AI Education: Teaching computational graph concepts interactively.

# Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single root node and zero or more child nodes. 
Trees are widely used in computer science for storing and organizing data efficiently.

Types of Trees:
- Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children.
- Binary Search Tree (BST): Left child < parent < right child; allows efficient searching.
- AVL Tree: Self-balancing BST to maintain height balance.
- N-ary Tree: Nodes can have more than two children.
- Trie: Specialized tree for storing strings; used in dictionaries and autocomplete.

Applications:
1. File Systems: Represent folder structures.
2. Databases: Indexing (B-trees, B+ trees).
3. Networking: Routing tables.
4. Parsing: Abstract syntax trees in compilers.
5. AI: Decision trees in machine learning.

# Embeddings

Embeddings are vector representations of data (words, sentences, documents, or images) in a continuous vector space. 
They capture semantic meaning, allowing similarity calculations and machine learning tasks.

Common Types:
- Word Embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.
- Sentence Embeddings: Sentence-BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder.
- Document Embeddings: Averaging sentence embeddings or using transformer models.
- Image Embeddings: Representing images in vector space for similarity or classification.

Applications:
1. Semantic Search: Finding similar documents or answers.
2. Recommendation Systems: Matching user preferences.
3. Clustering and Classification: Grouping similar data.
4. Chatbots: Understanding user intent via vector similarity.

# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a framework where an LLM retrieves relevant context from external documents to generate accurate answers.

Key Concepts:
- Retriever: Finds relevant documents or chunks based on a query.
- Vector Store: Stores embeddings for fast similarity search.
- LLM: Uses retrieved context to produce an answer.
- Context Window: LLM input limit; splitting documents into chunks ensures context fits.

Best Practices:
1. Chunk documents logically (e.g., 1000-1500 characters per chunk).
2. Use high-quality embeddings for accurate retrieval.
3. Provide clear instructions in the prompt for better answers.
4. Avoid empty responses by encouraging LLM to answer based on context, even if approximate.

# Python & AI Concepts

- Python is a high-level programming language widely used in AI, ML, and data analysis.
- Key libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers.
- Transformers models: BERT, GPT, T5, FLAN-T5, LLaMA, etc., used for NLP tasks.
- LLMs can perform question answering, summarization, translation, and more.
- Combining embeddings with LLMs enables RAG pipelines for smart assistants.
